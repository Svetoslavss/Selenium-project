# Jenkins Webhook Integration with GitHub Using Ngrok
This guide explains how to set up a GitHub webhook to trigger Jenkins builds, with Jenkins being exposed to the internet using ngrok.

Pre-requisites
Jenkins installed and running on your local machine or server.
ngrok installed to expose Jenkins to the internet for webhook integration.
GitHub repository for which you want to set up the webhook.
Steps to Set Up Jenkins Webhook with Ngrok
Step 1: Install Ngrok
Download Ngrok:
Visit the ngrok website and download the ngrok executable for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Install Ngrok:
Unzip the downloaded file and place the ngrok executable in your system’s PATH or a directory of your choice.
Step 2: Expose Jenkins with Ngrok
Start Jenkins:

If Jenkins is not already running, start it using:
bash
Copy
java -jar jenkins.war
Start Ngrok:

Open a terminal and run the following command to expose Jenkins over the internet via ngrok:
bash
Copy
ngrok http 8080
This command tells ngrok to expose port 8080 (the default Jenkins port) over the internet.
Note: The public URL generated by ngrok will look like this:
cpp
Copy
http://<ngrok_subdomain>.ngrok.io
Step 3: Configure the GitHub Webhook
Go to Your GitHub Repository:

Navigate to the Settings of your GitHub repository.
Add a Webhook:

In the Webhooks section, click on Add webhook.
Payload URL: Enter the ngrok URL with the /github-webhook path. For example:
arduino
Copy
http://<ngrok_subdomain>.ngrok.io/github-webhook
Content type: Set this to application/json.
Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?: Select Just the push event (or any other event you prefer).
Click Add webhook.
Step 4: Configure Jenkins to Listen for the GitHub Webhook
Install Necessary Jenkins Plugins:

Ensure that the following plugins are installed in Jenkins:
GitHub plugin
GitHub Webhook plugin
Git plugin
To install plugins, go to Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available tab, search for the plugins, and install them.
Configure GitHub Webhook in Jenkins:

Go to Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System.
Scroll down to the GitHub Plugin section.
Add your GitHub credentials (personal access token or username/password).
Configure Jenkins to use the credentials for the webhook integration.
Configure the Job:

Go to your specific Jenkins job and configure it to listen for the GitHub webhook trigger.
Under the Build Triggers section, select GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling.
This will make Jenkins listen for the webhook notification and trigger a build when a push is made to the GitHub repository.
Save the Configuration.

Step 5: Test the Webhook Trigger
Make a Commit:

Make a commit to your GitHub repository.
This will trigger the webhook to send a POST request to the Jenkins server.
Verify in Jenkins:

Go to your Jenkins job and verify that the build was triggered successfully.
You can view the build logs to ensure everything is working as expected.
Step 6: Monitor Webhook Logs in GitHub
Check Webhook Delivery:
In GitHub, navigate to Settings → Webhooks → Recent Deliveries.
Check the status of the webhook delivery and ensure there were no errors. GitHub will show a status code (e.g., 200 OK) for the request.
